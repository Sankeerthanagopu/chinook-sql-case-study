# Chinook SQL Case Study – Real Business Insights Using SQL

Hey there!  
Welcome to my case study based on the **Chinook music store database**. This is a project I’m building step by step to improve my SQL skills — not just by running queries, but by thinking like a business analyst.

Each insight here is based on a real-world question that a company might ask — and I’ve tried to answer it using SQL, logic, and storytelling. I’m also documenting my learning as I go, so this will evolve over time.

## What is the Chinook Database?

The Chinook database is a sample dataset that represents a digital music store — kind of like a simplified version of iTunes. It contains information about:
- Customers and their locations
- Invoices and purchases
- Music tracks, artists, albums, and genres
- Sales reps and employee details

It’s perfect for practicing business data analysis.

## Key Tables I Used

| Table         | What it Stores |
|---------------|----------------|
| `Customer`    | Info about each customer — name, country, email |
| `Invoice`     | Every purchase made, with total amount, date, and billing info |
| `InvoiceLine` | Line items in each invoice — which track was bought, for how much |
| `Track`       | All music tracks in the store — with names, albums, genres |
| `Album`       | Albums, each linked to an artist |
| `Artist`      | Artist names |
| `Genre`       | Music genre categories (Rock, Jazz, etc.) |
| `Employee`    | Staff and sales reps (used for customer support data) |

## Tools Used

- SQL (SQLite)
- DB Browser for SQLite (to explore and run queries)
- Markdown (to explain insights)
- GitHub (to showcase everything here)

## What You’ll Find Here

Each folder inside `/insights` includes:
- The business question I tried to answer
- The SQL query I used
- A written explanation of what I found (in plain English)
- Business impact: *“Why should this insight matter to a company?”*

## Why I’m Doing This

I’m a Master’s student in Business Analytics, and I’m building this project to:
- Strengthen my problem-solving and SQL skills
- Think like a real analyst — not just a coder
- Create a portfolio that reflects how I approach data and storytelling
