# Chinook SQL Case Study – Business Insights from a Music Store

Hi! I'm a Business Analytics graduate student, and this is one of my first real-world data projects using SQL — not just for querying data, but for solving real business problems.

This case study explores the **Chinook music store database** using SQL to uncover insights on customers, revenue, artist performance, and genre trends.

##  What This Project Includes

**5 Business Insights** — each written like a real analyst would present in a meeting:
- Insight 1: Top spending customers by country  
- Insight 2: Most frequently purchased tracks  
- Insight 3: Countries that generate the most revenue  
- Insight 4: Top artists by album count and revenue  
- Insight 5: Revenue contribution by music genre

Each insight includes:
- Clean SQL queries  
- Real business value  
- Markdown summaries  
- A `.sql` file and `.md` file per insight

## Summary of Key Findings

Here’s what I uncovered through SQL-based analysis:

1. **Top customers are globally distributed**, not limited to one region — showing the business has international reach and potential for multi-region loyalty strategies.
2. **Some tracks are bought repeatedly**, but revenue across songs is relatively flat — signaling room to analyze deeper patterns like artist or genre trends.
3. **The USA leads in customer count and revenue**, but many countries with only one or two customers showed surprising revenue, pointing to untapped growth markets.
4. **A few artists dominate revenue**, even if they don’t have the most albums — highlighting the power of artist popularity and loyal fanbases.
5. **Some genres earn more with fewer tracks**, proving that quality and engagement outperform volume.

Each finding connects SQL skills with real-world business thinking.

## Business Value Delivered

Through this analysis, we answer questions like:
- Where are our top customers located?
- Which songs or artists are driving revenue?
- Are there growth opportunities in specific genres or countries?
- How can we use this data to drive smarter marketing, licensing, and product strategy?

## Tools Used

- **SQLite-style SQL** (via SQLBolt & browser-based playground)
- **Markdown** for documentation
- **GitHub** for version control and public portfolio

##  About the Chinook Database

The **Chinook database** is a sample dataset that simulates a digital music store. It contains information about:

- **Tracks** – individual songs available for purchase
- **Albums** – collections of tracks grouped by artist
- **Artists** – music creators associated with albums
- **Customers** – people who purchase music
- **Invoices & InvoiceLines** – represent purchases and their details
- **Geography** – customer country info for regional insights
- **Genres & MediaTypes** – classifications for music and file formats

This schema allows for realistic **relational joins**, aggregations, and business-level questions — making it a great learning tool for data analysts.


## What’s Next?

This is just the beginning of the story.

 I will extend this analysis by:
-  Combining **SQL + Python (Pandas/Matplotlib)**  
-  Building dashboards with **Power BI**  
-  Presenting summaries in **Excel**

I’ll continue updating this repository as I add visualizations and advanced analysis.




##  About Me

I'm currently pursuing my **Master’s in Business Analytics (2026)** and actively building a portfolio that reflects not just technical skills, but real-world thinking.  
If you're a recruiter, mentor, or fellow learner — I’d love your feedback or connection!
